My name is Abu Sufiyan Ansari and am from Ahmedabad.
I completed my bachleor in Bachleors of computer application from Saint Xavier's College, Ahmedabad.
I am pursuing my master in Masters of computer application from GLS University, Ahmedabad.
I came accross various programming languages like c, c++, .net, javascript, java, python, etc. 
But i choose to prefer python programming because it is more likely a English Language. Easy to understand.
